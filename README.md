## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Below is an image of the output of our multiple linear regresion summary data.

This tells us that both vehicle length and ground clearance produce a non-random amount of variance to the miles per gallon that the vehicle gets. When looking at the slope of the linear regression, this is not considered to be zero. This is becasue some of our variables had significant impact on our MPG variable. 

Overall, this linear model does predict miles per gallon effectively of the MechaCar prototypes. What lead to this conclusion is looking at the r-squared values. The multiple r-squared value is 0.7149 and the adjusted r-squared value is 0.6825.This tells us that our correlation between the variables and mpg is moderate to strong.
